# Demo blog platform
Purpose of the demo blog platform project is to create a simple blog platform with a backend, a web client and a mobile app for 
iOS and Android. In this project I intend to explore several technologies, like:
* Spring-Boot for the backend
* Angular (version 4) for the web client
* React-Native for the mobile apps
* Docker because it is awesome
* REST-assured for api/integration testing
* protractor for e2e-testing
* Gatling for performance testing
* Pipeline as code with a Jenkinsfile
* Probably more to come...

Note: This project has just started and is a Work in Progress...
